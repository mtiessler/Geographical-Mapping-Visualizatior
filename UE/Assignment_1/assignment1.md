## Overview
In this assignment, you will design an interactive visualization and provide a rigorous rationale for your design choices. You can draft your designs by hand or can use any graphics or charting tool.

### Data
Select one out of the two datasets described above to use for Assignment 1 and later Assignment 2.

## Assignment
Your task is to design a concept for an interactive visualization and provide explanatory text describing your design. In a first phase, you will characterize the data as well as the user with their tasks and goals. Based on this, you will design a concept for an interactive visualization that you believe effectively communicates the data according to the users and tasks. A central element in this context are interaction methods to query, explore, and analyze the data visually. While you must use the dataset given, note that you are free to filter and transform the data as you see fit to highlight the elements that you think are most important in the dataset.

## Description of Domain, Data, User, and Tasks
As a first step, perform a data, user, and task analysis describing and specifying for example:

### Data
- **Which parameters?**
- **What data types?** (e.g., nominal, ordinal, discrete, continuous, binary, etc.)
- **Which structure(s)?** (e.g., multidimensional, time-oriented, tree/hierarchy, network/graph, etc.)
- **Any specifics?**
- etc.

### Users & Domain
- **Who are the users of the visualization?** (e.g., administrator, physician, child, etc.)
- **What are the specifics of the target group?** (not merely "employee", but a more specific description like for example analyst in a specific department, manager, etc., including details of the characteristics of the respective user group)
- **Are the users familiar with certain kinds of representations?**
- **What is the application domain?**
- **Are there any specifics of the application domain?**

### At least 3 Tasks/Goals
- What do the users want to do with the data and which insights do they want to gain?

You can make assumptions about facts and circumstances that are not explicitly stated (e.g., users, their tasks, etc.).

## Conceptual Design
As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a dataset, document what aspects of the data you are attempting to most effectively communicate. In short, what story (or stories) are you trying to tell? Just as important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured or down-played due to your visualization design.

In your write-up, you should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions and document the assumptions you have made. Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data. These decisions include the choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as the use of sorting or other data transformations. How do these decisions facilitate effective communication?

### Discuss for Example:
- Which visualization technique(s) are applied?
- What kind of visual mappings are applied? (How are data variables mapped to visual variables - e.g., data variable "filesize" --> visual variable "area")
- How can users interact?
- What can users do with the different interaction methods (e.g., navigate, zoom, highlight, dynamic querying, selection, brushing, etc.)?
- How are users supported in carrying out their tasks?
- What are the specifics of your design?
- What are possible improvements/extensions?
- etc.

## Submission Details
This is a group assignment. The assignment is to be handed in as a PDF document including the elaborations mentioned above as well as the mockups/fake screenshots (at least two sketches). This assignment can be carried out using pencil & paper only (no need for any visualization tools) - do not let your creativity be limited by the tool you might be using!
